# robotframework-win10
## Windows 10 - Robot framework
* Download & install Python 3 (Python 2 support stops in 2020)
* Download & install pip
## Robot Framework
### Install
```pip install robot framework``` - https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/master/INSTALL.rst
### Additional libraries
```pip install robotframework-requests``` - https://github.com/bulkan/robotframework-requests

```pip install robotframework-httplibrary``` - https://github.com/peritus/robotframework-httplibrary

```pip install robotframework-selenium2library``` - https://github.com/robotframework/Selenium2Library

```pip install robotframework-appiumlibrary``` - https://github.com/serhatbolsu/robotframework-appiumlibrary

### Mobile

Using appium to run mobile tests with Robot Framework.

### Android + Windows 10 ONLY

* Tests can be run over wifi to a device (must be on same network) or via USB debugging: https://blog.usejournal.com/run-your-appium-tests-on-real-devices-over-wifi-d70b7e7f6aeb
* To inspect:
	* Using appium desktop, start a server
	* Start a new session with capabiltities for an emulator or physical device (same as test capabilities)
	* Starg session
* Loading an app
	* If it's not installed, include ```app=fullPathToApk``` + ```fullReset``` capabilites
	* If it's already installed, find fill out the respective values for ```appActivity``` & ```appPackage``` (check appium server logs if unsure)


## Usage
### Test architecture
### POM
* Screens are stored as separate files, with variables and methods created to represent actions on that specific screen
* This method of creating 'Page Objects' can be used for APIs, Web UIs and Mobile UI
* No assertions on content or data, unless required
* The tests themselves utilize the Page Object methods as test steps, using assertions as part of the test cases based on available Page Object data

### KDD
* Keywords wrap methods and code, allowing user-friendly tests instructions to be used instead
* Assists in debugging, troubleshooting and test reports
* Useful when involving people with minimal coding & test automation experience to create test case

### BDD
* Adds a simpler plain English abstraction layer over test code, abstracting keywords even more
* This can lead to over-abstraction. Essentially, covering code with so many layers its now become more difficult to update methods or add new code
* Useful when involving people with basic, if any, coding & test automation experience to create or review test cases

### Best practices
* Use tabs to auto complete statements
* Ensure double spaces placed within, not tabs
* Double spaces are vital to running tests
* Implement design patterns to reduce test file size 
* Promote abstraction within tests to create modular keywords and variables
* Double spaces after equals, between arguments
* Single space after Library and test case names 
* Add tags to test cases underneath the test case name
* When testing APIs, will need to register a HTTP certificate on the machine
* Ensure browser drivers are up-to date or in-sync with libraries used. If one (e.g. driver) is older than the other(e.g. SeleniumLibrary), some functionality may be impacted

### Execution
* Can add in parameters into CLI for test result location, files, suites, tags and more
* Doesn't run on GitBash CLI. Works on cmd + powershell. 
* Run single test file: ```robot Tests/test.robot```
* Run single test case: ```robot -t testCaseName Tests/test.robot```
* Run whole test suite (based on parent directory): ```robot Tests./```
* Run single test on ff: Add ```Open Browser  ${BROWSER}``` in file and in CLI use ```robot -i Smoke -v BROWSER:browserName .\Tests\Udemy\test-homepage.robot```. Browsers include ```gc, ff, ie, edge```
* Run test case with custom parameters, use the following examples:
```
*** Keywords ***
Enter email 
	[Arguments]  ${email}
	Input Text  css=#id_email  ${email}

*** Test Case ***
Test form
    Enter email  customEmailParameter
```

## Review
* Easy to start writing acceptance, e2e and API tests
* Mobile requires external software + hardware, additional steps required before test creation
* Can easily be integrated into build servers such as Jenkins 
* Single log + report pages for each test suite, can keep refreshing page OR read in XML report data into another system (charts)
* Seems like extra work to wrap already wrapped keywords. Must be consistent across all various keywords used (there are many variations of a similar action)
* Test cases can become full Resource references
* Resource keywords end up having same name as test cases
* No history of tests run by default, as the Log + Report files are always replaced with latest
